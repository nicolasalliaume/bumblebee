Bumblebee
=========

Bumblebee is a python script that allows you to replace strings in any text file (.txt, .log, .xml, .json, etc) with any other strings you want.
It simply iterates over all files and folders from a given directory, making the configured replacements.

One great thing about Bumblebee is that it does not replace the string in your original files. Insted, it creates a new directory structure just like the original one, but with the strings replaced as you wanted.

Another great feature of Bumblebee is that it allows you to filter the files as you wish by providing a simple filtering function that you can fill in with any logical condition you want having the name of the file as your input (plus any other globals you wish to define).

Finally, Bumblebee is really (I mean, really) simple, so you can understand ir easily and make any change you want to suit your replacement requirements.

I hope you find *him* usefull!
